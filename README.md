## Notice of Current Development - 16/05/2023

The development of this specific repo is highly unstable and is suited towards my needs. Using this repo to update current stable versions of HLstats will result in it breaking.

I take no responsibility for any issues, instabilities and breakages that occur when using my development of HLstats and will not provide support for this development.

Thank you to [A1mDev](https://github.com/A1mDev/hlstatsx-community-edition) for your fixes for PHP8.
